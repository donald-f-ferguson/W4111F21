                      I am a third semester student pursuing M.S. in Computer Science on the Software Systems track.
                      I have taken COMS 4111 last semester and will be the TA for the course this semester.
                      I am from India and did my undergrad from IIT (ISM), Dhanbad in Computer Science and Engineering.
                      This summer I interned at Amazon in the AWS Aurora MySQL team. This class gave me a lot of useful
                      knowledge of Databases that helped me in my internship hunt. After completing my masters, I will be
                      returning full time at Amazon.
                      I am excited to meet you all in person and work with you this semester.
